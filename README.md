# GrindStone 

GrindStone is a personal project aimed at building a highly functional and motivating productivity planner. At its core, it's a calendar-based task manager that helps users plan and structure their days more intentionally — breaking things down hour-by-hour to make every grind session count.

## Overview

In its current (early) stage, GrindStone focuses on:

- Creating a clean and responsive **daily/weekly planner UI**
- Allowing users to **add, update, and schedule tasks** throughout the day
- Implementing **basic user authentication** to support user-specific planners
- Leveraging a **PostgreSQL database** to persist tasks and user data
- Built entirely using **Svelte**, with an emphasis on performance and modern frontend practices

This is a solo project created to explore new technologies and reinforce full-stack principles — from frontend polish to backend infrastructure.

## Status

GrindStone is in **early development**. Core features are currently being implemented, including:

- User login/signup
- Task creation and time-based scheduling
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Base UI components and project scaffolding
- Stylisitc theme will focus around a medieval aesthetic that I'd like to extend to additional future themes

## Future Goals

As the project matures, GrindStone will evolve into more than just a task tracker:

- **Gamified XP system** – earn experience points by completing tasks
- **Virtual pet/progress avatar** – visually reflect your productivity
- **Categorized stats** – boost traits like intelligence, strength, and mental health based on task types
- **Streaks and habits** – reward consistency with unlocks and buffs

The goal is to make daily planning *fun* and *rewarding* — a productivity dojo where consistency earns real (digital) gains.
